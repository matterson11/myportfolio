                    is to become a Full Stack Php Developer.</p>

                <p class="col-xs-12 text-center m-t-none m-b-xl">I started my working life in the Recruitment Industry.
                    Spending three years with a small consultancy before moving on to start my own independent
                    consultancy.</p>
                <p class="col-xs-12 text-center m-t-none m-b-xl">Several months later a friend and I began developing a
                    new business idea for an online recruitment platform. I used my consultancy as a way of financing
                    the new venture and eventually merging the two. That took us through 2015, but unfortunately the
                    business didn’t work out as we’d hoped and in March was shut down.</p>
                <p class="col-xs-12 text-center m-t-none m-b-xl">The silver lining from this endeavour has been my
                    introduction to the world of Web Development.</p>

                <h1 class="col-xs-12 text-center text-primary m-t-none m-b">Why Web Development?</h1>
                <hr class="col-xs-6 col-xs-offset-3 m-t-xs p-none">
                <p class="col-xs-12 text-center m-t-none m-b-xl">It all began so that I could understand the technical
                    aspects and support my business partner with the more basic duties, such as managing the user
                    database and posting blogs.</p>
                <p class="col-xs-12 text-center m-t-none m-b-xl">It soon became a genuine interest and I began spending
                    all the time I could to learn and, eventually, dabble inside our websites code for practical
                    experience.</p>
                <p class="col-xs-12 text-center m-t-none m-b-xl">When the business began to show signs of failing, that
                    loss was balanced by the possibility of finally having found a career path that I enjoy. My efforts
                    are now focused towards ensuring I successfully break into a career as a Web Developer.</p>
                <p class="col-xs-12 text-center m-t-none m-b-xl">I still have a lot to learn. However, if a business is
                    willing to help me develop I will return that investment with dedication, loyalty and a great work
                    ethic.</p>

                <p class="col-xs-12 text-center m-t-none m-b-xl">The experience of running my own business has
                    fundamentally altered my attitudes toward working and the value of learning. I thrive being under
                    pressure and working long hours. I actively push myself to continue developing my practical
                    development skills and engage in extracurricular activities.</p>
                <p class="col-xs-12 text-center m-t-none m-b-xl">I’m fully committed to becoming a great Developer and
                    will continue to dedicate considerable time to learning outside of working hours. These next two
                    years are about getting my new career off the ground. Gaining as much experience and learning all
                    that’s possible. I would appreciate being considered.</p>
